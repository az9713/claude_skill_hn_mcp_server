            <h2>Section 1</h2>
            <p>, hello everyone, and welcome to today's lecture on Machine Learning fundamentals. So, , today we're going to cover, , the basic concepts that underpin all of Machine Learning. First, let's talk about Supervised Learning. This is, , the most common type of Machine Learning. In Supervised Learning, we have labeled data - that means we know the correct answers for our training examples.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="section-2">
            <h2>Section 2</h2>
            <p>The algorithm learns from these examples and then can make predictions on new, unseen data. There are two main types of Supervised Learning problems: Classification and Regression. Classification is when we're trying to predict discrete categories, is this email spam or not spam. Regression is when we're predicting continuous values, what will the temperature be tomorrow. , let's look at a specific example - Decision Trees.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="section-3">
            <h2>Section 3</h2>
            <p>These are, , really intuitive models. A Decision Tree makes predictions by asking a series of questions about the input features. Each internal node represents a question, and each leaf node represents a prediction. Now, , moving on to Unsupervised Learning. This is where things get really interesting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="section-4">
            <h2>Section 4</h2>
            <p>In Unsupervised Learning, we don't have labeled data. The algorithm has to find patterns on its own. Common techniques include Clustering, where we group similar data points together. K-means Clustering is probably the most well-known clustering algorithm. It works by iteratively assigning data points to clusters and updating cluster centers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="section-5">
            <h2>Section 5</h2>
            <p>The algorithm continues until the cluster assignments stop changing. Another important concept is Dimensionality Reduction. This is, , super useful when dealing with high-dimensional data. Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, is a popular technique for this. PCA finds the directions of maximum variance in the data and projects onto those directions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="section-6">
            <h2>Section 6</h2>
            <p>Finally, let's briefly discuss Reinforcement Learning. This is, , quite different from the other two. In Reinforcement Learning, an agent learns by interacting with an environment. The agent takes actions and receives rewards or penalties based on those actions. The goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="section-7">
            <h2>Section 7</h2>
            <p>This type of learning is used in game playing, robotics, and many other applications. So, to summarize: we've covered Supervised Learning with Classification and Regression, Unsupervised Learning with Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction, and Reinforcement Learning with agents and environments. These are the fundamental paradigms of Machine Learning that you'll encounter throughout this course. In our next lecture, we'll dive deeper into specific algorithms and their mathematical foundations. , any questions.</p>
